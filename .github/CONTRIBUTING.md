# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving Salvo! 🎉

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repo and branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
2. Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and sync deps: `uv sync --extra dev`
3. Run the always-green offline path: `OFFLINE=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest`

> Run Python via `.venv/bin/python` (not `uv run`) in an offline shell — `uv run`
> re-syncs and can drop the pre-installed `genblaze` wheels when the network is absent.

## Before You Open a PR
- Lint passes: `ruff check .`
- Tests pass: `OFFLINE=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest`
- API smoke passes: boot `uvicorn app.main:app` and probe `/healthz` (see the `make e2e` target)
- Add or update tests for any behavior change.
- Keep commits conventional (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`).

## The OFFLINE contract
`OFFLINE=1` (mock providers + `LocalDirBackend`, zero network, zero credentials) must
stay green at all times — it is both the no-credentials dev path and the demo-day
disaster fallback. Never merge a change that reds the offline suite.
