## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead,
report them privately:

- Email **edy.cu@live.com**, or
- Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) (Security → Report a vulnerability).

You'll get an acknowledgment within 48 hours and a resolution timeline after
triage. Please give us a reasonable window to patch before public disclosure.

## Handling of secrets
Salvo never commits credentials. `.env` is gitignored (only `.env.example` is
tracked); B2 and provider keys live outside the tree. CI runs the OFFLINE path with
no credentials, and secret scanning (TruffleHog + GitHub secret scanning) guards the
history.
